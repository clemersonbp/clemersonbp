### Hello guys! Welcome to my simple profile! 😁

**About me**

My name is Clémerson, I live in São Leopoldo / RS, I'm 34 years old and I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development in the first half of 2022. I've been working since September 2021 as a FrontEnd Developer at Compasso Uol (it's my first professional experience as a Dev 😍) .

I currently work on a platform called OCC (Oracle Commerce Cloud), where we use JS, Jquery and KnockoutJS as the main tools for development, in addition to Less / Css in styling.

Soon our project should migrate to ReactJS (in place of Knockout and Jquery) and I'm looking to prepare myself to contribute at a high level with the time when this happens!

I love web development and recently I had some experiences with React Native that chose me very curious and with some plans for the future! 😉

Feel free to call me for a chat! I will be very happy! And in everything I can help you, I'm available!

Big hug! 🚀🚀🚀
